# Objective

Analyze accident trends by time of day

Study the impact of weather conditions

Identify geographic accident hotspots

Examine severity distribution

# Tools Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# Analysis Performed

Extracted hour and day from timestamp

Visualized accidents by hour to observe rush-hour trends

Analyzed top weather conditions during accidents

Studied accident severity distribution

Identified high-accident states

Plotted accident hotspot locations using latitude and longitude

# Key Insights

Accidents peak during morning and evening rush hours

Adverse weather conditions increase accident frequency

Certain states show higher accident concentration

Visibility and weather conditions influence accident severity

# Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis helped uncover patterns in traffic accidents and highlighted the influence of time, weather, and location on accident occurrence.
